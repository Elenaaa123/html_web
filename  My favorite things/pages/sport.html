			Running... this is time for me... with my me. I love to go for a run!
			<br>
			Morning is my favorite time... while everyone is still sleeping, it is very
			<br>
			quiet outside, nature is waking up around, all the plants around have an incredible aroma!
			<br>
			You start running... with headphones in your ears, with your thoughts!
			<br>
			I run run from 8-10 km. I don't feel this distance, you just move, run!
			<br>
			You will climb for health, for the heart, for the figure, for mental health!
			<br>
			When you don't even want to go for a run, but you force yourself!
			<br>
			It increases self-esteem, gives self-confidence! So if you don't run yet...
			<br>
			Try it you can
